Scripts
=======

The scripts in this folder take care of processing and calculating new data
from the current hubway data.

hubparser.py

router.py
---------

The prototype routing script. This routing script depends on the installation
of [graphserver](https://github.com/graphserver/graphserver/), which installs
a set of C and Python libraries which interact with compiled OSM data extracts.

This is the process to recreate the data extract files:

  1. Download the Massachusetts highways OSM extract from cloudmade: 
  [http://download.cloudmade.com/americas/northern_america/united_states/massachusetts/massachusetts.highway.osm.bz2]

  2. Using [osmosis](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis), extract the
  region around the hubway stations:
  
      > osmosis --read-xml file=massachusetts.highway.osm --bounding-box \
      left=-71.24645 bottom=42.21182 right=-70.9357 top=42.48643 --write-xml \
      file=boston.osm
      
  3. Compile the .osm file into a .osmdb sqlite file:
  
      > gs_osmdb_compile boston.osm boston.osmdb
      
  4. Compile the .osmdb file into a graphserver .gdb sqlite file:
  
      > gs_import_osm boston.gdb boston.osmdb
      
  5. The remaining .db file is generated by hubparser.py from the raw trips and 
  station .csv files.
